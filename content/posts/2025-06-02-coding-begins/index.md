Today marks the end of the community bonding period, and the start of the coding period, of GSoC.

In the last two weeks, I've been looking into other crossword editors that are on the market, in order to see what features they have that we should implement. I compiled everything I saw into a [findings document](https://pad.gnome.org/s/aGYPwTen5).

Once that was done, I went through the document and distilled it down into a final list. I also added other feature ideas that I already had in mind.

Eventually, through a discussion with my mentor, we decided that I should start by tackling a [bug that I found](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/issues/269). This will help me get more familiar with the fill algorithm code, and it will inform my decisions going forward, in terms of what features I should work on.
