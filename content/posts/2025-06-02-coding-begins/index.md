Today marks the end of the community bonding period, and the start of the coding period, of GSoC.

In the last two weeks, I've been looking into other crossword editors that are on the market, in order to see what features they have that we should implement.

I found the whole process enlightening. It was interesting to compare many different versions of the same product. The UIs were often quite different, some features only existed in a few or even a single editor, and the same feature may be implemented differently in each editor.

I wrote down everything I saw into a [findings document](https://pad.gnome.org/s/aGYPwTen5). This document will be useful in the future, whenever a comprehensive overview of other crossword editors on the market are needed. But in the meantime, I used the document to compile a list of potential feature ideas for Crosswords. I also added some other feature ideas that I already had in mind.

Eventually, through a discussion with my mentor, we decided that I should start by tackling a [bug that I found](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/issues/269). This will help me get more familiar with the fill algorithm code, and it will inform my decisions going forward, in terms of what features I should work on.
