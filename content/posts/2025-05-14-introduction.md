I will be contributing to GNOME Crosswords, as part of the Google Summer of Code 2025 program. My project adds construction aids to the Crosswords editor. These aids provide hints, warnings, and statistics that help the user create better crossword puzzles.

## GNOME Crosswords

The [GNOME Crosswords](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords) project consists of two parts:
* The [Crosswords player](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords), which you can use to play crossword puzzles.
* The [Crosswords editor](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords.Editor), which you can use to create crossword puzzles.

My project focuses on the Crosswords editor.
