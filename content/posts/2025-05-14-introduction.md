I will be contributing to GNOME Crosswords, as part of the Google Summer of Code 2025 program. My project adds construction aids to the Crosswords editor. These aids provide hints, warnings, and statistics that help the user create better crossword puzzles.

## GNOME Crosswords

The [GNOME Crosswords](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords) project consists of two parts:
* The [Crosswords player](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords), which you can use to play crossword puzzles.
* The [Crosswords editor](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords.Editor), which you can use to create crossword puzzles.

My project focuses on the Crosswords editor.

If you would like to learn more about GNOME Crosswords, check out the [GUADEC presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcQfpQLLzYo) that Jonathan Blandford, the creator of Crosswords, gave last year.

## Crossword construction

Creating a crossword is tricky. Creating a *good* crossword is even trickier. There are many things to take into account. For example:
* Are the words interesting?
* Are there any words that are so uncommon as to feel unfair?
* Does the puzzle have a good variety of parts of speech?
* Is the grid rotationally symmetric?
* Are there any unchecked squares?

Crossword editing software can make this process easier---certainly not easy---but easier. For example, the GNOME Crosswords editor gives you a list of possible words for a given row or column
