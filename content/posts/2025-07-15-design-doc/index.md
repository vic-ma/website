In the last two weeks, I investigated some bugs, tested some fonts, and started working on a design doc.

## Bugs

I found a few more UI-related bugs ([1](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/issues/280), [2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/issues/281), [3](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/issues/282)). This is in addition to the ones I mentioned in my last blog post.
