For Google Summer of Code 2025, I worked on [GNOME Crosswords](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords). GNOME Crosswords consists of a crossword player called [Crosswords](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords) and a crossword editor called [Crossword Editor](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords.Editor). I worked on the crossword editor.


## Project summary

I improved GNOME Crossword Editor's word suggestion algorithm, by re-implementing it as a forward-checking algorithm. Previously, our word suggestion algorithm only considered the constraints imposed by the intersection where the cursor is. This resulted in frequent dead-end word suggestions, which led to user frustration.

To fix this problem, I re-implemented our word suggestion algorithm to consider the constraints imposed by every intersection in the current slot. This significantly reduces the number of dead-end word suggestions and leads to a better user experience.

As part of this project, I also researched the field of constraint satisfaction problems and wrote a report on how we can use the AC-3 algorithm to further improve our word suggestion algorithm in the future.

I also performed a competitive analysis of other crossword editors on the market and wrote a detailed report, to help identify missing features and guide future development.

## Word suggestion algorithm improvements

The goal of any crossword editor software is to make it as easy as possible to create a good crossword puzzle. To that end, almost every crossword editor has a [*word suggestion list*](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords/-/raw/master/data/images/edit-grid.png)---a dynamic list of words that fit the current slot. This feature helps the user find words that fit their grid.


The list of words is generated by a *word suggestion algorithm*.

At a minimum, the word suggestion algorithm should take into account the size of the slot and any letters that are already in the slot. For example, if the slot looks like `C A _ S`, then the word suggestion algorithm should only suggest four-letter words that start with *CA* and end in *S*. This is a very basic word suggestion algorithm, and it's not too far off from the algorithm that our crossword editor had.

### The problem

Consider this grid:
```
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | Z |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | E |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | R |
+---+---+---+---+
| W | O | R |   | < current slot
+---+---+---+---+
```
4-Down begins with *ZER*, so the only word it can be is *ZERO*. This constrains
the bottom-right cell to the letter *O*.

4-Across starts with *WOR*. We know that the bottom-right cell must be *O*, so
that means that 4-Across must be *WORO*. But *WORO* is not a word. So, 4-Down
and 4-Across are both unfillable, because no letter fits in the bottom-right
cell.

However, our editor's word suggestion algorithm did not handle this grid properly. Our algorithm only considered the constraint imposed by the current slot and the intersecting slot at the current cell. So if the current cell is the bottom-right cell, then our algorithm correctly handled the grid. But if the current cell is any of the other cells, then the algorithm did not correctly handle the grid. The algorithm generated words like *WORD* and *WORM*, even though those words do not actually fit in the slot, because they cause 4-Down to become a nonsense word.
